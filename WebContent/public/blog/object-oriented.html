			<h1>Object Oriented Programming - Initial Post</h1>

			<div style="text-align: justify;">
				As many other people my first contact with programming was by far
				not an <span style="font-weight: bold;">Object Oriented</span>
				language. In my case my first programming tool was the well
				remembered “flowchart” (which by the way I think is a great tool to
				start..) After we developed some logic and understood the very
				basics of loops, processes and flows then we moved into what it was
				my first official language which was Pascal, a procedural
				programming language designed in the late 60's and initially thought
				as a language to teach students structured programming. As soon as I
				started loving Pascal and picturing myself as a successful skilled
				Pascal programmer (I was feeling very confident programming my first
				very basic console programs), somebody told me well guess what??
				Pascal is so old and so useless that nobody uses it anymore other
				than teaching purposes. Of course I was shocked!! How come??? so now
				the language which for 6 “long” months I have learned with so much
				passion is useless??? well yes, said this person!! now what you have
				to learn is an <span style="font-weight: bold;">Object
					Oriented Programming</span> Language called <span
					style="font-weight: bold;">Java</span>!!<br />
				<br />That day, I had the pleasure to meet the well old known
				programmer's friend called CHANGE. Which up to now always shows up,
				just as my first days with Pascal whenever I start feeling
				comfortable using a particular technology (languages, framework,
				APIs or whatever.. ). Therefore, after being witness of the radical
				changes that have occurred during the last years I've learned to
				appreciate the basics of programming and the importance to learn
				them well; because the basis of programming haven't changed much for
				40 years.<br />
				<br />As well after that day I heard for the first time the term
				Object Oriented Programming or <span style="font-weight: bold;">OOP</span>
				for short. To be honest at the beginning it was somehow confusing
				for me to fully understand it, I used to read about: encapsulation,
				abstract classes, polymorphism, interfaces, objects, inheritance,
				and many other terms that I was really not sure what their real
				purpose was.<br />
				<br />The idea of this post is to give an introduction to OOP. In
				further posts I will be writing about its basic concepts and posting
				some code examples to exemplify the concepts discussed here. I will
				be using Java since it is a known programming language among
				software developers and the one I have more experience with. It is
				important to note that the topics discussed here are being thought
				in Java terms, so they might slightly differ from other OO
				languages. But first some history..<br />
				<br />
				<span style="font-weight: bold;">History</span><br />
				<br />The terms “objects” and “oriented” seem to make first
				appearance at MIT during the late 50's and early 60's in different
				research projects taking place on this university at that time.
				However, it is considered to be SIMULA the first object oriented
				language. As its name suggests it was used to create simulations.
				Alan Kay, who was at the University of Utah at the time, liked what
				he saw in the SIMULA language. He had a vision of a personal
				computer that would provide graphics-oriented applications and he
				felt that a language like SIMULA would provide a good way for
				non-specialists to create these applications. He sold his vision to
				Xerox Parc and in the early 1970s, a team headed by Alan Kay at
				Xerox Parc created the first personal computer called the Dynabook.
				Smalltalk was the object-oriented language developed for programming
				the Dynabook. It was a simulation and graphics-oriented programming
				language. Smalltalk exists to this day although it is not widely
				used commercially.<br />
				<br />The idea of object-oriented programming gained popularity in
				the 1970s and in the early 1980s Bjorn Stroustrup integrated
				object-oriented programming into the C language. The resulting
				language was called C++ and it became the first object-oriented
				language to be widely used commercially.<br />
				<br />In the early 1990s a group at Sun led by James Gosling
				developed a C++ based language called Java which was originally
				designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the
				digital cable television industry at the time. This project was
				going nowhere until the group re-oriented its focus and marketed
				Java as a language for programming Internet applications. After
				that, the language has gained widespread popularity and nowadays is
				widely used and constantly new languages are being influenced by it
				(i.e. Python, PHP, C#, SCALA ). Since then Java hasn't stopped
				evolving and is one of the favorite languages used in the academia
				and the industry.<br />
				<br />For the initial posts I will assume that the reader has never
				used an <span style="font-weight: bold;">OOP </span>language before
				so I will start defining the most very basic concepts. I think it is
				a good idea to do so because as I said I really believe that
				learning the basics and learn them well are going to really help to
				avoid misunderstandings that can later lead us to get lost on the
				topic and get frustrated. So having said that, if you are an
				experienced programmer definitely this will be old stuff for you.
				However, if you are not I will firstly cover what <span
					style="font-weight: bold;">objects, classes, inheritance,
					interfaces and packages</span> are. Having done that we will be ready to
				move to real code examples.
